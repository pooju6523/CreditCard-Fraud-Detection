# Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning
This repository contains Credit card fraud detection algorithm using machine learning techniques in python.

**_Credit Card Fraud Detection_** : With a lot of people, banks and online retailer being a victim of credit card fraud, a model detecting whether the transaction is fraud or not an help in saving a huge amount of money.
Prediction, Classification,confusion_matrix done in this project.
**_Dataset_** : The dataset has been obtained from kaggle.You can find the dataset in the link provided below:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
	 The values of columns V1-V28 in the dataset may be result of a PCA(Principal Component Analysis) Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive information. There are no missing values in the dataset. 

**_Algorithm_** : The algorithm used in this dataset is Random Forest algorithm.
		 or model improvement normalization and SMOTE techniques (to handle imbalanced data) were used.
